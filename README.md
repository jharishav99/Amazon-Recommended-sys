# Amazon-Recommended-sys

This project implements a recommendation system similar to Amazon's product recommendation engine. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and recommendation algorithms to suggest items to users based on their historical preferences.

Features
Natural Language Processing: Analyzes user reviews and product descriptions using NLP to extract meaningful features.

Collaborative Filtering: Implements collaborative filtering techniques (e.g., user-based, item-based) to suggest items based on user behavior and preferences.

Content-Based Filtering: Utilizes product features and attributes to recommend items similar to those a user has shown interest in.

Matrix Factorization: Applies matrix factorization methods (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition) to uncover latent factors influencing user preferences.
